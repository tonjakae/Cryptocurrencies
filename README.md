# Cryptocurrencies: Module 18 Analysis

## Overview
Martha is a senior manager for the Advisory Services Team at Accountability Accounting, one of our most important clients. Accountability Accounting, a prominent investment bank, is interested in offering a new cryptocurrency investment portfolio for its customers. The company, however, is lost in the vast universe of cryptocurrencies. So, theyâ€™ve asked me to create a report that includes what cryptocurrencies are on the trading market and how they could be grouped to create a classification system for this new investment.

### This new assignment consists of four technical analysis deliverables:
* Deliverable 1: Preprocessing the Data for PCA
* Deliverable 2: Reducing Data Dimensions Using PCA
* Deliverable 3: Clustering Cryptocurrencies Using K-means
* Deliverable 4: Visualizing Cryptocurrencies Results

## Deliverable 1: Preprocessing the Data for PCA
### Keep all the cryptocurrencies that are being traded.

### Drop the IsTrading column.

### Remove rows that have at least one null value.

### Filter the crypto_df DataFrame so it only has rows where coins have been mined.

### Create a new DataFrame that holds only the cryptocurrency names, and use the crypto_df DataFrame index as the index for this new DataFrame.

### Remove the CoinName column from the crypto_df DataFrame since it's not going to be used on the clustering algorithm.

### Use the get_dummies() method to create variables for the two text features, Algorithm and ProofType, and store the resulting data in a new DataFrame named X.

### Use the StandardScaler fit_transform() function to standardize the features from the X DataFrame.
